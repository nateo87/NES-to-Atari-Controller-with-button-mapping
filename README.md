# NES-to-Atari-Controller-with-button-mapping
A way to make use of the start and select buttons when modding an NES controller to work with the Atari 9-pin standard.

When playing games on consoles/computers like the Atari 2600, Commodore 64, etc, I tend to eschew the joysticks of the era and opt instead for a gamepad. They're just a lot more comfortable to me and tend to be a lot nicer to left-handers like myself. Also, a lot of platforming games for these machines tend to use 'up' for jump, amd that dog won't hunt, monsignor. For this purpose, I modded an NES controller to work with the Atari 9-pin standard, and had the A button wired to 'up' for jump and B for 'fire'.
But what if you want A to be used for fire instead, as is often in a lot of shooters designed for the NES? It feels weird to use the B button for that purpose. You could use a mechanical SPDT switch to change the mapping of the A button, but that requires drilling a hole in the case, and having a random switch sticking out of this otherwise cleanly designed controller would look, how you say, inelegant. But hey now - there's two perfectly good, otherwise unused buttons sitting right in the middle of the controller! Wouldn't it be nice if we could make use of those instead?
